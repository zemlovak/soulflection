        "Child's pose, also known as balasana, is a beginner's yoga pose designed to relax the body and mind. The name derives from the Sanskrit words bala, meaning “young and child-like,” and asana, meaning “seat or a seated posture.” Child's pose can be used as a resting pose during yoga practice before and after more advanced poses.",
      instructions: [
        "Kneel on your yoga mat, resting your buttocks against your heels. Place your palms on your thighs and bring your feet close together. Inhale and exhale slowly, allowing your shoulders to relax.",
        "In your own time, lower your upper body onto your thighs on an exhale. Extend your arms out in front of you with your palms face down on the mat. Keep your big toes touching and spread your knees wide enough for your torso to lower between your thighs. If pregnant, be sure to spread your knees wide enough to avoid putting pressure on your abdomen.",
        "Rest your forehead on your yoga mat and relax your neck. For added comfort, consider placing a blanket, bolster, pillow, or your hands beneath your forehead. Close your eyes and relax your jaw. If you experience a headache during child's pose, slowly lift your back and shoulders, keeping your neck relaxed, and sit up to take a break.",
        "If your hip joints are tight, consider keeping your knees together and lowering your torso on top of your thighs. For a more passive pose, let your arms relax behind you along your thighs with palms facing up. Place a rolled towel below your shins to take the pressure off your ankles. Use caution when practicing child's pose if you've suffered a knee injury.",
        "Allow your muscles to loosen while you rest against your mat. For added support, place a folded blanket or pillow between your calves and the bottom of your thighs. Keep your eyes closed and focus on your body, staying mindful of any physical sensations.",
        "Explore different breathing exercises while practicing child's pose. Inhale slowly, feeling your lungs expand against your back body. While exhaling, concentrate on releasing tension from your back and stomach. Continue this breathing exercise for one to three minutes.",
