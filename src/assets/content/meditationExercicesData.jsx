          description:
            "The body scan meditation, or body awareness, is an exercise that allows you to tune out distractions while focusing on various areas of the body. Body Scanning is a great technique that helps you become more aware of how you are feeling in any given moment. Excess muscle tension exacerbates muscle pain, headaches, and fatigue, and scanning the body can help you prevent the build-up of pressure. You can either do a quick body scan or a more extended scan. A quick scan can help you immediately release tension, and it only takes a few seconds.",

          description:
            "Diaphragmatic breathing or abdominal breathing is another good way to ease stress and anxiety.

            "Progressive muscle relaxation is a simple exercise where you tense and release all the muscles in your body, working your way up from the feet and toes to the head. The exercise is designed to help the body progressively relax, just like the name sounds. This technique can help decrease muscle tension, fatigue, neck and back pain, or even muscle spasms. This technique also reduces the physiological tension caused by thoughts that tend to provoke anxiety. In this exercise, you should strive to tense and then relax all of those large muscles in the body. This should be done systematically either working your way down from the head or up from the feet and toes. Deep muscle relaxation helps reduce physiological tension as well.",
